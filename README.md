# React/Redux Task

A simple task using `redux`, `react` and `redux-thunk`.

## The task

Use your http library of choice (`fetch`, `axios`, etc.) to interface with the [Github Developer API](https://developer.github.com/v3/). Your app should allow users to `search` for Github accounts via freetext input field, and display a list of all repositories owned by that account.

##### Getting technical
Ideally, you'll use these standards:
- `Redux` to manage your application state
- `React` class components for stateful components with logic
- `React` stateless functional components for presenting UI
- `styled-components` to style your app (just some simple styles will do!)

## Setup

Use `create-react-app` to bootstrap your application. 

## Submission

To submit your code for review, submit a pull request to this repository with your completed task.
